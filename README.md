# Resource Calendar
## Objective

To create an alternative to the FullCalendar jquery plugin. Improvements over FullCalendar include:
* Tableless layout
* Overridable rendering functions
* Events become independent objects that can be transferred between Calendars
* A new Resource container class, giving a hierarchy of Calendar -> one or more Resources -> zero or more Events
* Extensible Policies - locked events, nudge later events on insert, inter-event gaps
